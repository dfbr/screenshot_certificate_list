# Screenshot Certificate List

Automated screenshots of domains found in certificate transparency logs via
[crt.sh](https://crt.sh/).

The workflow runs daily (and can be triggered manually). For every domain in
[`domains.txt`](domains.txt) it:

1. Queries **crt.sh** for all current certificates whose common name ends with
   that domain (e.g. `%.uib.no`).
2. Filters out wildcard entries and deduplicates the list.
3. Takes a **screenshot** of each reachable site (HTTPS first, then HTTP).
4. Saves everything to a date-stamped directory under `results/<domain>/`.
5. Generates a **README.md** inside that directory with an image gallery.
6. Keeps only the most recent **5 runs** per domain (configurable).

Multiple domains are processed **concurrently** as separate GitHub Actions
matrix jobs.

## Adding / Removing Domains

Edit [`domains.txt`](domains.txt) — one domain per line; lines starting with
`#` are ignored.

## Manual Triggering

Go to **Actions → Screenshot Certificate List → Run workflow** and optionally
override:

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `max_runs` | `5` | Runs to keep per domain |
| `max_domains` | `50` | Max domains to screenshot per run (`0` = unlimited) |
